POMB Finance is an algorithmic asset protocol. While it uses proven mechanisms inspired by previous models, it is **not a guaranteed stablecoin**. Its peg relies on market dynamics, liquidity incentives, and user participation.

All participants should understand the risks of algorithmic assets before interacting with the protocol. Smart contracts may contain vulnerabilities, and market volatility can lead to temporary or sustained price deviations from the peg.

Always **DYOR (Do Your Own Research)** and never invest more than you can afford to lose.
