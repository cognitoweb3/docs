The **Genesis Phase** is the launch event where \$POMB is distributed to early participants before regular farming and emissions begin.

During Genesis, users can deposit supported assets to earn \$POMB over a fixed period. After Genesis ends, these pools close permanently and regular farming begins.

\
**Genesis Supported Assets:**

- \$XPL
- \$USDT0
- \$USDe
- \$DIA
- \$ETH
- and other strategic ecosystem tokens

Genesis is designed to bootstrap liquidity and reward early supporters who help kickstart the protocol.
