title: "ðŸ“– Overview"

The **\$POMB token** is the foundation of the POMB Finance ecosystem. Its primary objective is to **maintain a 1:1 peg with \$XPL** and provide deeper utility for the networkâ€™s native assets.

The protocol dynamically adjusts the supply of \$POMB based on market conditions, helping to stabilize its price while rewarding users who contribute to the ecosystem.

**POMB Finance **uses a multi-token model consisting of two key assets:

- **\$POMB** - The algorithmic token designed to maintain a peg to \$XPL.
- **\$sPOMB** - The share token representing ownership in the protocol and entitling holders to newly minted \$POMB during expansion phases.

When **\$POMB** is above peg, the protocol mints new supply which is distributed to \$SPOMB stakers. When it is below peg, no new tokens are minted, allowing demand to catch up and restore balance. This creates a self-sustaining flywheel of incentives and growth.
