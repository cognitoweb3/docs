Once Genesis ends, POMB Finance transitions to its main phase. Here, users can earn \$SPOMB â€” the governance and reward token â€” by providing liquidity and staking LP tokens.

Liquidity is essential for \$POMB to maintain its peg and trade smoothly. To incentivize this, farms distribute \$SPOMB to liquidity providers who stake their LP tokens in the platform.

## **Boardroom**

The **Boardroom** is the heart of the POMB ecosystem. Itâ€™s where \$SPOMB holders stake their tokens to receive newly minted \$POMB during expansion periods.

## **How It Works**

- Stake \$SPOMB in the Boardroom.
- When the TWAP of \$POMB is above 1\$XML, the protocol mints new \$POMB.
- These new tokens are distributed to all \$SPOMB stakers proportinally to their stake.

Rewards are typically distributed every epoch (e.g., every 6 hours), and claiming them is as simple as clicking a button.

The Boardroom aligns incentives: those who believe in the long-term health of the protocol and lock in their \$SPOMB are directly rewarded as the ecosystem grows.
