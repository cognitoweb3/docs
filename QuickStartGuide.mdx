Welcome to **POMB Finance** â€” the algorithmic protocol on Plasma designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with \$PLASMA and reward active participants. This guide walks you through everything you need to know to get started and begin earning.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Join the Genesis Phase (Optional but Recommended)">
    The **Genesis Phase** is a limited-time event where you can earn \$POMB before regular farming begins.

    1. Visit the **Genesis page** on the POMB app.
    2. Connect your wallet (make sure you're on the Plasma Network).
    3. Deposit supported assets (like \$XPL, \$USDT0, \$ETH, etc.).
    4. Earn \$POMB passively during the Genesis event.
    5. Once Genesis ends, claim your \$POMB.

    <Tip>
      Genesis is the best way to secure an early position in the ecosystem.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Liquidity">
    To participate in farms and earn \$SPOMB, you'll first need to provide liquidity for \$POMB pairs.

    1. Go to a supported DEX (e.g., DYOR)
    2. Add liquidity for pairs like:
       - \$POMB-XML
       - \$SPOMB-XML
       - \$POMB-ETH
    3. Receive **LP Tokens** in return - these represent your share of the liquidity pool.

    <Tip>
      LP Tokens are your key to farming rewards - keep them in your wallet.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stake $SPOMB in the Boardroom">
    Now that you have LP tokens, you can stake them in the POMB farms to start earning \$SPOMB.

    1. Navigate to the **Farms** section of the POMB dApp.
    2. Choose a pool (e.g., Fusion Field for \$POMB-XML LP).
    3. Approve and stake your LP tokens.
    4. Earn \$SPOMB passively over time.

    <Tip>
      The more LP you stake, the higher your share of rewards.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stake $SPOMB in the Boardroom">
    Once youâ€™ve earned some \$sPOMB, you can stake it in the **Boardroom** to earn newly minted \$POMB during expansion periods.

    1. Go to the **Boardroom** page.
    2. Stake your \$sPOMB.
    3. When \$POMB trades above its peg, the protocol mints new \$POMB.
    4. Your share of this expansion is automatically distributed based on how much \$sPOMB you have staked.

    <Tip>
      The Boardroom is where the highest yield opportunities exist â€” but rewards only flow when \$POMB is above peg.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compound and Grow">
    To maximize returns, repeat the cycle:

    - Claim \$POMB rewards from the Boardroom.
    - Add them back to liquidity pools.
    - Stake LP to earn more \$SPOMB.
    - Stake \$SPOMB to earn even more \$POMB.

    <Tip>
      This flywheel effect is the core of the POMB ecosystem â€” the more you participate, the more you earn.
